# FriendBase

A idea which is to be made in 1 month (jeez). Its cool because I have gotten 3 people doing this Website app thing.

I will be holding the Main repo so if any changes are being made either :
  1) Message me on Discord (id : Twlight_zone#7037 )
  2) Mail me ( mail : twlightzonehelp@gmail.com )
  3) call me ( you should already have my number if your concerned to do this one )
  
  
Anyways here are the things which are actually infomatic : 
  1) This project is made in Expo's newest TS support
  2) This project is being done by @Aradhya-Shaswat and me ofc (will add others when they agree)
  3) We will deploy this sometime this year only soo follow us on our Github for updates.
  
We are accepting any and all helpful pull-reqs; be sure to give them here!
